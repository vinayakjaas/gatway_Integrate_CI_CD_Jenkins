## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) involves automating the process of code integration and testing regularly. Continuous Deployment (CD) extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production after passing tests. Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before setting up the project:

- Jenkins Server
- Git
- Docker
- Node.js
- Any other project-specific dependencies

## Installation

1. Install Jenkins: Follow the official [Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

2. Install necessary plugins: Open Jenkins, navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins," and install plugins such as Git, Docker, Node.js, etc., depending on your project needs.

3. Set up Jenkins jobs: Create Jenkins jobs for building, testing, and deploying your application. Configure webhooks to trigger builds on code changes.

## Configuration

Configure Jenkins by setting up global configurations, including Git credentials, Docker configurations, and any other environment variables needed for your project.

1. Add Git credentials: Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials" and add credentials for accessing your Git repository.

2. Configure Docker: Ensure Jenkins can communicate with your Docker daemon. You may need to add the Jenkins user to the Docker group and restart Jenkins.

3. Set up Node.js: If your project involves Node.js, configure Jenkins to use the correct Node.js version.

## Usage

1. Push changes to the repository: Whenever you push changes to your Git repository, Jenkins will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

2. Monitor Jenkins dashboard: Check the Jenkins dashboard for build and deployment status. View build logs for troubleshooting.

## Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile`. This file contains stages for building, testing, and deploying the application. Customize the pipeline according to your project structure and requirements.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and submit a pull request.
